Spotify is an audio streaming service used by *hundreds of millions* of people. Each song is associated with metadata that describe its acoustic attributes (*acousticness*, danceability, durationms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, timesignature, valence), genre, and an index that describes the popularity of the song. We propose to model the popularity index based on the acoustic attributes and genre. There are several published Spotify datasets, but these are several years old. Others have attempted to model popularity from the acoustic attributes and genre, but most have used linear models that did not perform well. We will generate a new, updated database of Spotify songs by generating random song IDs and searching the Spotify API. Then we will model song popularity (dependent variable) using acoustic attributes and genre (independent variables). We will use different approaches to modeling and compare the results.
